## ECE 35: Introduction to Analog Design
- Contents Learned: </br>
TBD
- Course Structure: </br>
Our class was conducted in a flipped classroom form, where students need to watch videos before class, and do reading quizzes. During lecture session, professor will give clicker questions(participation based). We had 3 exams, and 1 final, about 1-3 homework a week, and biweekly labs. Labs are easy, homeworks are done on an online platform(free) with limited attempts. Exams have similar questions like homework. Final is harder than exams. Final will replace grading category if it helps.
- Workload: </br>
Not that heavy, you just need to understand the concepts and how to apply them to solve problems under time constraint. I spent around 6-8 hours a week outside of class for ECE 35.
- Grade: </br>
A, class average was C+, Curt does not curve.
- Professor: </br>
Curt Schurgers, he will really challenge you and make sure you understand the class material
- Class Resources: </br>
For preperation of exams, I only do homework and practice problems/exams Curt gave us, plus a little bit of problems from Sadiku Circuit textbook.
- Comment: </br>
It's a good intro to circuit analysis class, it really trained your problem solving abilities. I personally does not really have interest in circuit, but I found this class to be enjoyable.


## CSE 21: Mathematics for Algorithms and Systems


## CSE 29: Systems Programming and Software Tools
- Contents Learned: </br>
- Course Structure: </br>
You do like 5 programming assignments, our quarter was UTF8-encodings, password cracker, web chat server, malloc and free implementation, and mini shell. The first 2 ones are not that hard, the third and last ones are ok, the malloc and free one is hard.
Professors will go through the logic(but not neccessary the code) for each PA. There are 3 exams and no final. Your grade is calculated on standard based. For example, you need to attend 8/10 labs, get 2 full points, and 1 partial point for exams, and PA points must add up to 12 to get an A, if you lack one of the requirement in the letter grade you want, you're mega cooked.

If you know C programming then it should be not that bad, I spent like 10 hours a week for this class.
- Grade: </br>
A+, most of the people who got A's were A+'s. And people who did not do well on exams would get B's, C's, or F's. Class is not curved and to get good grades in this class you really need to do well on all portions of the class grading criteria(exams, PAs, labs(attendance)).
- Professor:</br>
Aaron Schulman cotaught with Joe Politz. I took it with Aaron and I found his class really enjoyable.
- Class Resources: </br>
Just do the PA's and chatgpt is allowed, this class is really hands on and learn by doing
- Comment: </br>
Really valuable class to take, especially if you want to do system programming related jobs in the future. It gives you all the basics you need.

## ANTH 21: Race and Racisms
- Contents Learned: </br>
TBD
- Course Structure: </br>
Online midterm, online final, open notes, open internet. About 4 writing assignments in the whole quarter. Discussions are mandatory and count towards your grade. But lectures attendance is optional, also the lectures are not podcasted.
- Workload: </br>
I only had to spend time on writing the essays, because it requires you to read the class material(text/articles/and stuff professor gave). If you're good at writing then this class is a free A for you. Other than writing, I did not spend much time on this class.
- Grade: </br>
A+, most of people got either A or A+.
- Professor: </br>
Anika Stone, her lectures just going through powerpoint, and the powerpoint slides are really detailed, so just reading them also helps.
- Class Resources: </br>
Read the articles and texts the professor assigneed, then you're good to go
- Comment: </br>
I took this class for DEI requirement, was pretty chill. Although personally I did not find this class particularly interesting, I would still say it's a great class to take for fulfiling DEI requirments.
